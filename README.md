# Cereal Shiny Web Application

## App Functions

 This app uses the cereal.tsv dataset to display different nutritional information about types of cereal by brand. With the two sidebar widgets, whoever is viewing the app is able to change the manufacturer of cereal and then within that manufacturer, they can choose to view a bar graph comparing the companies individual cereals based on calories, protein, fat, sodium, fiber, carbs, sugar, potassium, vitamins, number of cups per serving, and the cereal's rating.
